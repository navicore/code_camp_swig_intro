Developed and tested on linux with gcc and gmake.

The makefiles need to know where your perl, python, 
and/or ruby installations are so rename the 
CONFIG_sample file to CONFIG and edit the lines 
marked "EDIT THIS LINE"

The *.bundle files are sym links to *.so files, 
these are only used by some runtimes on OSX

The code/example_01 example illustrates the simplest 
swig usage, generating a program from just a header 
file.

The code/example_02 example illustrates this tutorial's 
recommended approach, using a *.i file and the %extends 
keyword.

The code/example_03 is the same as example_2 but with
exeptions.  THIS IS THE EXAMPLE I WISH I HAD WHEN I 
STARTED WITH SWIG.

The code/example_04 example is a simple sqlite api. 
THIS EXAMPLE IS INCOMPLETE, but it shows how to 
instantiate a sqlite db.  I will post a more useful 
version as example_04 soon...
