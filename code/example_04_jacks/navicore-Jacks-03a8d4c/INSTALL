Installation Instructions

*************************
PLEASE READ THE WHOLE FILE!  THIS BUILD SYSTEM IS NOT 100% YET!
*************************

If you have downloaded the entire repo with git, run ./autogen.sh before
running ./configure

./configure --help
./configure --with-perl [--with-python2 --with-python3 --with-ruby --with-lua]
make
make check
sudo make install


*************************
when configuring for a version of python that is not the
default, use PYTHON_VERSION= on configure command.

./configure --with-python3 PYTHON_VERSION=3


*************************
Note, "make install" seems to work for perl but the other langs
need some tweaking.  Best to cd to the example-client dir
of the module/lang you are interested in installing and 
manually copy the required files from there.  Some modules
are implemented with a single shared lib and some a wrapper
for shared lib.

ie: for python, 

cd modules/python2/example-clients
the files you need to deploy are: _jackscript.so and jackscript.py


for lua,

cd modules/lua/example-clients
the file you need to deploy is jackscript.so


*************************
This situation should be temporary, I'll make the build 
system automate the creationg of idiomatically correct 
distributions for each lang we support.
